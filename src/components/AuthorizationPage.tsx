Here's the fixed version of the code with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// Added missing closing bracket for the contract address input div
            )}
          </div>

// Added missing closing bracket for the AuthorizationPage component
};
```

The main issues were:

1. A missing closing bracket for the contract address input div section
2. A missing closing bracket for the entire AuthorizationPage component

The fixed code should now be properly balanced with all opening and closing brackets matched correctly.
